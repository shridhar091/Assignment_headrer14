# Headers_14

I build a standard web page using HTML and CSS. 
You can get the HTML file from the index.html, Where you get the HTML code and some inline CSS 
In style.css file you get the 80% of stlying of the page. That is a EXTERNAL CSS.

I deployed this page live also you can get this page from this link:- https://vercel.com/shridhar091s-projects/assignment
